<h1 align="center">Welcome to Chromium 👋</h1>

<strong>Campaign Monitor</strong> is a web app that allows its users to capture data to an online mailing list, manage it, and send HTML e-newsletters to it. It's a 'software as a service' tool, meaning you don't own the app but pay a monthly fee to use it.

In this project we have tried to clone the front end of <strong>Campaign Monitor</strong>. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned so far in the masai school, we were able to clone the front end with high precision and quality.

<br/>

- This is a Clone of the Campaign Monitor website
- and it was made in 1 week.
- The technologies used are beginner friendly and easy to use.
- If you are interested in contributing to this project feel free to do so.
